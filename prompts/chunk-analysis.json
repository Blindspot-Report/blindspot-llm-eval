    "content": "Analyze the following podcast transcript and extract political information. Cover the full scope of the transcript — do not focus on only one section.\n\nEach sentence is numbered with [N] at the start. Use these numbers to reference quotes.\n\nReturn a JSON object with these exact fields:\n{\n  \"keyPoints\": [\"string array of 3-10 main political claims, arguments, or positions expressed\"],\n  \"quotes\": [\n    {\n      \"startIndex\": <sentence number>,\n      \"endIndex\": <sentence number>,\n      \"context\": \"why this quote is politically significant\",\n      \"significance\": \"high|medium|low\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"stanceSignals\": [\n    {\n      \"topic\": \"political topic discussed (e.g., immigration, taxes, healthcare)\",\n      \"position\": \"the position expressed (e.g., supports stricter immigration, opposes tax increases)\",\n      \"strength\": \"strong|moderate|weak\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"topics\": [\"array of main political topics discussed\"],\n  \"tone\": \"overall tone of this segment (e.g., confrontational, analytical, passionate, neutral)\"\n}\n\nGuidelines:\n- For quotes: Select 0-5 quotes that best capture political viewpoints. Specify the sentence range using startIndex and endIndex (inclusive). For a single-sentence quote, set startIndex = endIndex. Only use sentence numbers that appear in the transcript below.\n- For stanceSignals: Only include clear political positions, not neutral statements.\n- For keyPoints: Focus on political claims, not general conversation.\n- If the segment has no political content, return empty arrays and \"neutral\" tone.\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n{{transcript}}\n\nRespond with valid JSON only:"
